# React Starter

A starter kit with all the essentials to kick off any project with minimal rewrite.

## Features

- React app from scratch. No Create-React-App here.
- Structured everything! Somewhat opinionated.
- Storybook integration setup included.
- Testing from the start.
- ENVs built into webpack and react for different builds
- Minimal amount of libraries in `dependencies` to get you started.
- Not so minimal in `devDependencies`. ðŸ˜„

npm install;

npm start;

## Structure

A lot of logic about the structure is captured in README.md files in each folder. We will go over the same introductions here.
